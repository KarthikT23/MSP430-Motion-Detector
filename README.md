# MSP430-Motion-Detector
A motion detector using MSP430 microcontroller, code on energia

# Problem Statement
To detect the motion of objects through IR rays emitted by the PIR Sensor and causing a sound using buzzer, lighting up an LED upon the detection of motion

# Energia software
https://energia.nu/

# Components 

A) PIR Sensor Module

B) TI-MSP430 Launchpad

C) LED

D) Buzzer

E) Breadboard

F) Jumper wires

# Circuitry
The VCC and GND pins of module is connected to VCC and GND pins of MSP430. The output pin of module is connected to 8th pin (P2.0) of MSP430. Although any pin can be used but you have to state the mode of the pin as input. The 6th pin (P1.4) is connected to LED and buzzer.
